* <a href="https://github.com/UCIDataLab/uci-digital-evidence/tree/main/code"> Sample code for calculating likelihood ratios for categorical count data</a>: R and Python notebooks which contain code for assessing the likelihood that two sets of categorical counts were generated by the same source and for assessing the likelihood that a set of categorical events contains a changepoint.

## Sample code for likelihood ratios for categorical count data

* `categorical_count_lr.ipynb` is a Python notebook which walks through sample code for calculating likelihood ratios for categorical count data
* `categorical_count_lr.Rmd` is an R version of the above notebook (`categorical_count_lr.md` should render the Rmd file for easier reading in GitHub)

## Sample code for likelihood ratios for categorical events with an unknown changepoint

* * `unknown_changepoint_count_lr.Rmd` is an R notebook which walks through sample code for calculating likelihood ratios for categorical event data with an unknown changepoint (`unknown_changepoint_count_lr.md` should render the Rmd file for easier reading in GitHub)
